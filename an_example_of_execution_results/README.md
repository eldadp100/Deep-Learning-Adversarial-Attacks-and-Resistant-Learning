## Example Execution
This folder is splitted to MNIST and Traffic Signs examples. It shows the results of executing the project on them.

The log contains the training and adversarial training scores and another information of the execution. There's also a plot folder for some examples of generated adversarial examples (To show more of them increase the number of figures in configs.py).

I did those executions on the submitted files.
